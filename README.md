# **MongoDB Querying and Aggregation Project**


> In this project, I will not be doing any major CRUD operation as I will use mongimport to create the database, collection, and to import the documents which are in JSON format.

> [!NOTE] 
> I will be using the mongo shell (mongosh) to carry out all the operations and not mongo atlas or any other third party application.
